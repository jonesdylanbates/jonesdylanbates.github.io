The majority of 700 points schools serve at least grades 3 through 8.\nFor the proficiency row, you can score up to 100 points for each subject (ELA, math, and science).\nFor the growth of all row, you can score up to 125 points for math and ELA only. The reason you can score up to 125 points is because you could see where all of your students grew at least 2 levels or grew to the advanced proficiency level.\nFor the growth of LPS (low performing students), you can score up to 125 points for math and ELA only. The reasong you can score up to 125 points is the same as the growth of all students category. The different is the the LPS students are predetermined by the MDE. Students that fall into the LPS category are the \u0026ldquo;bottom 25%\u0026rdquo; for their grade level and subject.\nFor more information, please visit the \u0026ldquo;Accountability Model\u0026rdquo; section of the support site.

If your school falls into any of these categories, please click here.\nUsing the impact data from MAAP testing, the MDE assigns your school and district an \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; through \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; letter grade. All users for each school is able to see thier schools impact data because this data is open to the public.\nEquity Analytics allows you to view all impact data for your school from school year 2015-2016 to present. The MDE started recording impact data in 2016, when the MS transistioned to the new state standards and cooresponding accountbility model.\nIf you are interested, click here to view the MDE\u0026rsquo;s most recent accountability standards.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/growth_model/purpose/','title':"Purpose of the Accountability Model",'section':"Accountability Model",'content':"Mississippi Department of Education (MDE) Accountability Overvieww #  What is the Accountability Model for Mississippi Public Schools? #  MDE\u0026rsquo;s Definition of the Accountability Model\nThe Office of District and School Performance (ODSP) provides state, district, and school level accountability (performance) measures on an annual basis. These data measures are used to help stakeholders make decisions regarding areas of improvement and need within our state education system. The Mississippi Statewide Accountability System assigns a performance rating of A, B, C, D, and F for each school and district based on established criteria regarding student achievement, individual student growth, graduation rate, and participation rate. Statewide assessments are used to measure proficiency and growth in proficiency for students in grades 3-8 and high school students taking end-of-course subject area assessments in Algebra I, English II, Biology, and U.S. History. Schools and districts are expected to have an assessment participation rate of 95% or greater.\nMore information can be found here.\n What does the Accountability Model mean for me? #  At the end of the day, the accountability model simply tells you how your school, and more importantly your students, are performing on the end-of-year MAAP assessments.\nThe most notable feature of the Accountability Model is the A through F rating scale. While the rating scale is important, it is important to not get caught up in the specific letter.\nThink of the accountability rating as:\n An indication of how your students are performing in math, ELA, science and history An indication of how much your students are growing academically each time they are assessed in math and ELA. An indication of how much your low performing students are growing academically each time they are assessed in math and ELA. An indication of whether or not your student is performing above or below expecations.  The grade levels of \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; are considered below expecations. The grade level of \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; is considered the expectation (it is also considered the beginning \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; status). The grade levels of \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; are considered above expecations (These grade levels of also considered \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo; status).
