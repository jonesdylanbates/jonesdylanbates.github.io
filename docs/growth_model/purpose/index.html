  <p><strong>MDE&rsquo;s Definition of the Accountability Model</strong></p>
<p>The Office of District and School Performance (ODSP) provides state, district, and school level accountability (performance) measures on an annual basis. These data measures are used to help stakeholders make decisions regarding areas of improvement and need within our state education system. The Mississippi Statewide Accountability System assigns a performance rating of A, B, C, D, and F for each school and district based on established criteria regarding student achievement, individual student growth, graduation rate, and participation rate. Statewide assessments are used to measure proficiency and growth in proficiency for students in grades 3-8 and high school students taking end-of-course subject area assessments in Algebra I, English II, Biology, and U.S. History. Schools and districts are expected to have an assessment participation rate of 95% or greater.</p>
<p>More information can be found <a href="https://www.mdek12.org/OPR/Reporting/Accountability">here</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the accountability model simply tells you how
your school, and more importantly your students, are performing on the
end-of-year MAAP assessments.</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the Accountability Model is the A through F
rating scale. While the rating scale is important, it is important to
not get caught up in the specific letter.</p>
<p>Think of the accountability rating as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An indication of how your students are performing in math, ELA,
science and history</li>
<li>An indication of how much your students are growing academically
each time they are assessed in math and ELA.</li>
<li>An indication of how much your low performing students are growing
academically each time they are assessed in math and ELA.</li>
<li>An indication of whether or not your student is performing above or
below expecations.
<ul>
<li>The grade levels of &ldquo;D&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; are considered below expecations.</li>
<li>The grade level of &ldquo;C&rdquo; is considered the expectation (it is also
considered the beginning &ldquo;successful&rdquo; status).</li>
<li>The grade levels of &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; are considered above expecations
(These grade levels of also considered &ldquo;successful&rdquo; status).</li>
</ul>
</li>
