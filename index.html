  About the Founder
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-the-founder">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The idea that led to Equity Analytics started in Room 12 of the
Inverness Elementary School located in Inverness, MS. I was was frustrated
with how much data I had access to but no good way to quickly analyze and
make decesions with the data. Especially my becnhmark data, I had no
good way to figure out how my students were performing on their
benchmark relative to the Mississippi Department of Education (MDE)
accountability model. Fastword to today, Equity Analytics is centered
around the idea of making the lives of educators easier by have a
&ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for all thier student&rsquo;s data.</p>
