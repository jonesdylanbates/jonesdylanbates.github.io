The majority of 700 points schools serve at least grades 3 through 8.\nFor the proficiency row, you can score up to 100 points for each subject (ELA, math, and science).\nFor the growth of all row, you can score up to 125 points for math and ELA only. The reason you can score up to 125 points is because you could see where all of your students grew at least 2 levels or grew to the advanced proficiency level.\nFor the growth of LPS (low performing students), you can score up to 125 points for math and ELA only. The reasong you can score up to 125 points is the same as the growth of all students category. The different is the the LPS students are predetermined by the MDE. Students that fall into the LPS category are the \u0026ldquo;bottom 25%\u0026rdquo; for their grade level and subject.\nFor more information, please visit the \u0026ldquo;Accountability Model\u0026rdquo; section of the support site.
